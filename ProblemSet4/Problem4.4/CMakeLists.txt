# - juce_gui_basics: Basic GUI components (buttons, sliders, windows, etc.).

# Additional Notes for Students:
# - If you add new source files or directories, make sure to update add_executable.
# - If you're using other JUCE modules, you'll need to link them under target_link_libraries.
# - Remember to keep your project directory organized as it grows (e.g., creating separate
#   folders for source code, headers, resources, etc.).
