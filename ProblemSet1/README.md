## Problem 1.4: Markdown
#####What is the code doing?

The code is simply printing a string to the screen. Firstly it includes the `<stdio.h>` header, which will be the source for the `printf()` function. Then, in the `main()` function, we simply print the string, and return a 0 to signal that the program is over and completed with no errors.

#####What programming elements are used in the code (e.g., comments)?

Elements used include: comments, the pre-processor command `#include`, as well as functions `main()`, and `printf()`.

#####What is the result of compiling and running the program?

Printing the string `Hello World!` to the screen.

#####What happens if you change the text inside double quotes (") within the printf function to something else?

The printed string will change to the string inputted in the `printf()` argument.
